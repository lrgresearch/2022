## Community outreach
As LRG, one of our primary goals is to support the free exchange of ideas and to ensure a close exchange of information with all concerned, primarily in academia. Based on the fact that knowledge increases as it is shared, we present our work as proceedings, articles and open-source software to those who are interested.

## Next in LRG
We believe that science and scientists should develop themselves in accordance with the spirit of the time. Adhering to this value, we are constantly asking what we can do on top of our own expertise. "Next in LRG" acts as a kind of blog for us where we write down our decisions that may affect our next few years. [Click for "Next in LRG" archive.](next-in-lrg.md)
