# Next in LRG
Science and scientists should develop themselves by the spirit of the time. Adhering to this value, we constantly ask what we can do on top of our expertise. "Next in LRG" acts as a kind of blog for us where we write down our decisions that may affect our next few years.

## Using New Tools and Continuing Strong
*Oct 22, 2024. S. B. Lisesivdin*

As we approach 2025, the LRG group at Gazi University continues its journey of scientific discoveries. This year promises to be transformative as we shift towards innovative tools, explore intriguing materials, and advance our ongoing projects with renewed focus and energy.

**1. Transition to work on HPC for Computational Studies:**
One of the most significant changes for 2025 will be in our Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies. In 2024, we decommissioned many of our computers due to their age. And, due to the Circular on Savings Measures issued in 2024, we can not put new computers in our laboratory. This year, the ARF cluster, which is in the Top 500, also started to work at TRUBA.  After years of relying on our local machines for GPAW calculations (and ATK in the past), we are now migrating to the TRUBA cluster to run our Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) simulations. This powerful resource will enhance our ability to conduct large-scale simulations with many atoms. However, our commitment to GPAW remains strong. We will continue to support and develop our in-house *gpaw-tools* software, ensuring it remains an essential part of our computational toolkit. And we will strongly use it in our BSc and MSc thesis works.

**2. Experimental Focus: Ca-Doped Silicon for Single Photon Emitters:**
On the experimental front, our attention will turn to investigating Ca-doped Silicon. The fascinating properties of Calcium, particularly its long T2 relaxation times, offer the potential to introduce defects that may enable silicon-based single photon emission. If successful, this study could open up new possibilities in quantum technologies, with applications ranging from quantum communication to cryptography. If not, it will provide an important amount of information to the literature about the doping properties of Calcium in Silicon.

**3. Continuing to Build on Our Expertise:**
LRG remains committed to leveraging the collective expertise we've cultivated over the years. We will continue to study low-dimensional materials, including nanoribbons, GaN-based materials, and carbon allotropes, while integrating new 2D materials into our research scope. Exploring defects, impurities, and structural nuances in these materials will be central to our thesis/dissertation work.

As always, LRG works on adapting to new scientific tools and opportunities, driven by the spirit of innovation. We look forward to sharing our progress and insights with the scientific community.

## Consolidating Our Scientific Efforts

*Dec 08, 2023. S. B. Lisesivdin*

As we enter the promising year 2024, Gazi University Low-Dimensional Materials and Systems Laboratory stands at the intersection of thinking and expectation. This year, we will focus on harmonizing knowledge and innovation by bringing together the different topics of our scientific pursuits. In this sense, this year will be a year of consolidation.

**1. Consolidation of Research Topics:**
In the spirit of growth and evolution, we are organizing our focus to delve deeper into critical areas of interest, consolidating our research topics by building on the foundations laid in previous years. The CuOXMist project remains a cornerstone, and we aim to build on our research into thin and doped oxide films in 2024. By combining our efforts, we hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of these material systems.

**2. Consolidation of Equipment and Software:**
A research group is only as strong as its tools; recognizing this, we are dedicating 2024 to consolidating our equipment and software. Our journey with GPAW and gpaw-tools has been transformative, and we are now ready to maximize the potential of these tools. We will have a similar consolidation effort in our experimental equipment.

**3. Hybrid Work Philosophy:**
The LRG has a hybrid approach to work, embracing flexibility in workspaces, subjects, and studying. This year, we are reaffirming our commitment to the hybrid working philosophy. Whether we focus on work in the lab or remotely, experimental or computational, we will combine our strengths to adapt to each situation.

As a result, consolidation emerges as the guiding principle as the LRG embarks on its next journey in 2024. By consolidating research topics, equipment and software, and our working philosophy, we aim to strengthen the foundations of our scientific endeavors. See you next year.


## CuOXMist and expanding the investigation of 2D/3D materials with defects and impurities

*Aug 23, 2022. S. B. Lisesivdin*

We had some obstacles a year ago before starting the scientific studies we envisioned for 2022. During this period, our experimental-based CuOXMist project, which includes copper oxide and gallium oxide growths, was accepted within our university and became active as of April 2022. Getting our computational studies to use GPAW and our gpaw-tools was time-consuming. We wrote code for long hours on gpaw-tools software using our means. And as of about July, gpaw-tools has been able to perform polyatomic LCAO calculations as we want. We have accelerated our computational studies as of July, and we have given importance to gathering experience in this field, which we have yet to be able to give due importance to in the last few years.

Looking at 2023, we foresee our work focusing on the issues mentioned above. Our experimental work will focus on oxide thin films and multistructures that we will grow within the scope of the CuOXMist project. In the computational field, we will focus on the calculations of some oxide materials associated with CuOXMist and the effects of defects and impurities in 2D and 3D materials on the electronic, elastic, and optical properties of those structures. It will be our priority to examine many different materials. We can also specialize in some interesting subjects in the following years.  

In addition to this, we will have many educational activities in 2023. In addition to the courses and students in Gazi University Science Institute, we will start teaching and employing graduate students at the Informatics Institute for the first time this year. We think these activities in the Informatics Institute will contribute to our computational studies and coding processes.

## Focus on Hybrid Investigation of Defects in 2D/3D Structures

*Sep 15, 2021. S. B. Lisesivdin*

As the pandemic continues, we have learned to study, work and educate with computers. LRG has a long past with computational studies and with the changing time, we changed and adapted to the time. As a hybrid group, we can do both experimental and computational studies, every student in our group knows both experimental and computational facilities in the laboratory. We are accepting this as a richness of possibilities. We can purely do computational studies, or experimental. Our projects always have both. Since 2011, we are using ATK for our Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies. However, because of living some problems with getting a new license through Europractice, we have been searching for new possibilities. For this, we chose GPAW for our further studies and have started a small software called gpaw-tools which is a UI/GUI. With gpaw-tools, it is now possible to do nearly all calculations that we have done with ATK. Because we are a small group now, in 2022, we will focus to use GPAW and develop gpaw-tools to make this migration without any problem.

With the migration to GPAW, we also want to focus our studies on the effects of low-dimensional phenomena. With relation to our previous experimental/computational studies done with the University of Ulm, we want to investigate the effects of defects on 2D/3D structures.

We also formed a sister lab at Lab-305 room. It is called Defect Hybrid Analysis Laboratory. It will also work on defects in semiconductors and insulators by computational and experimental ways of work. In Lab 335, we will continue to grow oxide materials and will investigate possible low-dimensional effects.

### Hybrid Operation in every situation

*Nov 23, 2020. S. B. Lisesivdin*

With the COVID-19 pandemic, our lives change invariably. As scientists and faculty members of a Gazi University, we have already changed to many things in our education system. With addition of our past experiences involving long term experimental system shutdowns, constructions and similar unpredictable problems we adapted and improved ourselves how to work and what to work.

As LRG Research Group, we want to continue our studies with a hybrid approach in "every sense" in the next few years.

1. **Hybrid working as type**: Beginning with the first days of our group we are studying both experimental and calculational subjects. All our projects included both parts of these study types. We would like to extend our studies in this sense.
2. **Hybrid working as place**: With the pandemic we are now can work locally or remotely. We can provide experimental or calculational subjects to our students with thinking possibility to attend laboratory or not.
3. **Hybrid working as subject**: Most of our subjects involving hybrid material systems to study. For example: We are interested in 2DEG populations in ZnO/GaN based *hybrid* heterostructures. We are also interested in GaN HEMT / Diamond NV center *hybrid* devices for 2DEG mapping. And list can be go up like this. The interactions between two material systems are giving many new possibilities and these possibilities make these subjects attractive.
4. **Hybrid education**: With the pandemic, our university utilized an online education system. We are performing our undergraduate and graduate courses using this system. In addition to these courses, our group uses video lectures in group-wide education of new MSc and PhD students and performing Zoom group meetings as well. Of course we are continuing to study face to face as much as pandemic regulations allows us.
