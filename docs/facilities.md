# Facilities

We are studying both experimentally and numerically. You may find more information about our facilities below.

## Experimental Studies

### Chemical Vapor Deposition System

We have an Ultrasonic Spray Chemical Vapor Deposition with a Remote Spark Plasma Generator for Ozone generation for the growth of ZnO, MgZnO, and their heterostructures.

### Electrical Characterization Laboratory

Most of the research activities in the wide band gap (WBG) materials and HEMT devices are carried out in this laboratory, where experimental facilities exist to investigate the electrical properties of semiconductors. The experimental sets include I/V, electrical transport, and hot electron (high voltage pulse measurements).


### Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) System

We have an AFM system for structural investigations. Our compact, tabletop AFM system has all the important features and benefits expected from a light lever AFM and includes everything required for high-resolution scanning. It has a passive vibration prevention system.

Sample Sizes:	Up to 1" X 1" X 3/4"
Standard Scanning Modes:	Vibrating(Tapping), Non-Vibrating (Contact), Phase, LFM
Scanners:	50 x 50 x 17 µm, 15 x 15 x 7 µm
Video Optical Microscope:	Zoom to 400X, 2 µm resolution
Stage and EBox Size:	Compact tabletop design with passive vibration prevention cabin.
